The Pancake Sorting Problem
This is a variation on the general idea of sorting. The idea is you have a stack
of pancakes, each one a different size from all the others. Initially, the
pancakes are stacked in some random order, and weâ€™d like to get them stacked in
order of size from smallest on top to largest on the bottom. At any point in
time, you can flip a portion of the stack by placing a spatula in between two
pancakes and turning over, as a block, the pancakes above the spatula.
