This took a lot of time to get right. Many implementations were scrapped, 
redrafted, redone, and rebuilt. Some of my latest attemps and ramblings are 
included in my hw1.py

I tried building some unit tests but ran out of time and patience.

All of my search algorithms work for `stack0`.

## Profiles

Summary of results for profiles I ran on my search algorithms. All these 
tests are run on `stack0`.

Iterative Deepening Search (IDS) used `0.9 MiB`.

Breadth First Search (BFS) used `0.2 MiB`.

A Star (A*) used `0 MiB`.

I achieved very similar values across my other runs (included in the 
[`other_runs/`](other_runs) folder.)
