# CISC 481 HW2 Writeup

I tried my best to finish this. I really did. I couldn't quite get it 
working, and I apologize for that. I got the web application side of things 
(part 6, 25 points) working very smoothly. My backtracking search (part 5) is 
all 
there according to the textbook psuedocode, but I just couldn't crack it. It 
just wouldn't work past the first step.

My minimum remaining values (part 4) is all there according to the textbook, 
as well. AC3 (part 3) may be implemented incorrectly, but again, it's mostly 
to what the book said. 

I had Professor Keffer look at my revise (part 2), and he said it looks 
perfect. So, that should not be the source of my issues.

I fully completed part 1 with generating all of the constraints for the 4x4 
and 9x9. See the included `four_constraints.py` and `four_domains.py` scripts. 

I have learned a lot, and if I were to do this course again, I would do a 
lot of things differently.
