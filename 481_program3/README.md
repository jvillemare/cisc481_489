# AI: HW3

Making our neural networks from scratch; Pain.

I tried my best to solve this assignment.  All parts of the original 
homework are attempted, but I'm not entirely sure if it's working.  It's 
super manual, super jank.  A lot of the ideas of the homework are there, and 
I hope that counts for something.

It does run, and that's pretty good I suppose.
