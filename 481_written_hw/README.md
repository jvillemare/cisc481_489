## Notes

Homework 3 was unlike any other hell that I've personally experienced. Would 
not wish on my worst enemy.

If your professor wants to waste hours of your life on this, then consider 
my homework 3 and extremely beginner friendly guide on how to do manual 
Bayesian Inference. Depending on the scope of problem they've defined, doing 
this will either take 1 hour, or 10 hours. Exponentially increasing 
suffering, something the geneva convention outlawed I think.
